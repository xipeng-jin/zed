# Collaboration {#collaboration}

Zed supports real-time multiplayer editing. Multiple people can work in the same project simultaneously, seeing each other's cursors and edits as they happen.

Open the Collaboration Panel with {#kb collab_panel::ToggleFocus}. You'll need to [sign in](../authentication.md#signing-in) to access collaboration features.

## Collaboration Panel {#collaboration-panel}

The Collaboration Panel has two sections:

1. [Channels](./channels.md): Persistent project rooms for team collaboration, with shared projects and voice chat.
2. [Contacts and Private Calls](./contacts-and-private-calls.md): Your contacts list for ad-hoc private sessions.

> **Warning:** Sharing a project gives collaborators access to your local file system within that project. Only collaborate with people you trust.
