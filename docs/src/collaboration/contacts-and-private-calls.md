# Contacts and Private Calls {#contacts}

Private calls provide ad-hoc collaboration sessions outside of channels. Add contacts to your list and start calls with one or more people.

## Adding a Contact

1. In the Collaboration Panel, click the `+` button next to the `Contacts` section
1. Search for the contact using their GitHub handle.\
   _Note: Your contact must be an existing Zed user who has completed the GitHub authentication sign-in flow._
1. Your contact will receive a notification.
   Once they accept, you'll both appear in each other's contact list.

## Private Calls

To start a private call:

1. Click the `...` menu next to an online contact's name in the Collaboration Panel.
1. Click `Call <username>`

Once you've begun a private call, you can add other online contacts by clicking their name in the Collaboration Panel.

_Private calls work like [channels](./channels.md), without channel-specific features such as channel notes._
