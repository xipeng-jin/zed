# Command Palette

The Command Palette is the main way to access actions in Zed. Its keybinding is one of the first shortcuts to learn: {#kb command_palette::Toggle}.

To try it, open the Command Palette and type `new file`. The command list should narrow to `workspace: new file`. Press Return to create a new buffer.

Any time you see instructions that include commands of the form `zed: ...` or `editor: ...` and so on that means you need to execute them in the Command Palette.
