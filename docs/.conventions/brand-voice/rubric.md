# Brand Voice Rubric

Score each criterion 1-5. Copy must score **4+ on ALL criteria** to pass.

---

## 1. Technical Grounding (1-5)

Does the copy make specific, verifiable technical claims?

| Score | Description                                                                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Precise technical details that can be verified (specs, architecture, measurable outcomes) |
| 4     | Concrete technical claims with clear meaning                                              |
| 3     | Mix of specific and vague technical references                                            |
| 2     | Mostly abstract with occasional technical terms                                           |
| 1     | No technical substance; pure marketing language                                           |

**Examples:**

- ✅ "Written in Rust with GPU-accelerated rendering at 120fps"
- ❌ "Blazingly fast performance that will transform your workflow"

---

## 2. Natural Syntax (1-5)

Does the writing flow like natural speech from a thoughtful developer?

| Score | Description                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Varied sentence structure, natural rhythm, reads aloud smoothly |
| 4     | Mostly natural with minor rhythm issues                         |
| 3     | Some AI patterns visible but not dominant                       |
| 2     | Obvious structural patterns (parallel triplets, em dash chains) |
| 1     | Robotic cadence, formulaic construction throughout              |

**Red flags:** Em dash overuse, "It's not X, it's Y" constructions, triple parallel lists, sentences all same length.

## 3. Quiet Confidence (1-5)

Does the copy state facts without hype or emotional manipulation?

| Score | Description                                              |

| 4     | Confident statements with minimal flourish               |
| 3     | Some restraint but occasional hype creeps in             |
| 2     | Frequent superlatives or emotional appeals               |
| 1     | Aggressive marketing tone, telling reader how to feel    |

**Examples:**

## 4. Developer Respect (1-5)

Does the copy treat the reader as a peer, not a prospect?

| 4     | Respectful with appropriate technical depth             |
| 3     | Slightly patronizing or oversimplified                  |
| 2     | Condescending explanations or forced enthusiasm         |
| 1     | Treats reader as uninformed consumer to be persuaded    |

**Examples:**

- ✅ "Tree-sitter provides incremental parsing, so syntax highlighting updates as you type."
- ❌ "Don't worry about the technical details — just know it's fast!"

---

## 5. Information Priority (1-5)

Is the most important information first?

| Score | Description                                         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| 1     | Key information buried or missing entirely          |

**Examples:**

## 6. Specificity (1-5)

Are claims concrete and measurable?

| Score | Description                            |
